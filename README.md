## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates my Python data analysis skills using Pandas and Matplotlib.  
The dataset contains random sales records, and the goal is to simulate the responsibilities of a data analyst by cleaning messy data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and extracting actionable business insights.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Import the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and explore its structure.  
- Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, fixing formatting issues, and converting columns to appropriate data types.  
- Perform exploratory analysis with descriptive statistics and aggregation.  
- Answer key business questions using Python and Pandas.

- Order ID  
- Product Name  
- Quantity Sold  
- Revenue  
- Payment Method  
- City  
- Manager  
- Date
